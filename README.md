# gitbomb
This repository contains scripts to create a gitbomb and example gitbombs in other branches

## Purpuse
This code was created for educational purposes only. 
I have put it under MIT license so that YOU are responsible for everything you do with it. 
So do not be evil. You have been warned. 

## Sources
The scripts are based on a blockpost written by Kate Murphy. (Thanks to Kate Murphy)
I have ported it from Python to bash so that you can run it from git bash directly without installing Python.
